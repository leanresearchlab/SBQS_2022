<h1 align="left"> Analyzing Test Smells Refactoring from a Developers Perspective </h1>

<h2 align="left"> Abstract </h2>

<p align="justify">
Test smells represent a set of poorly designed tests, which can harm
a test code’s maintenance and quality criteria. Although fundamental 
steps to understand test smells have been investigated, there
is still an evident lack of studies that evaluate the impact of test
smell refactoring from the perspective of internal quality attributes,
such as: size, cohesion, coupling and complexity. In addition, the
literature still lacks research that addresses the difficulties developers 
encounter during test smells refactoring. The paper aims to
investigate the impact of test smells refactoring from developers’
perspective and internal quality attributes. We investigated the
perceptions and difficulties encountered by 20 developers while
removing 5 types of test smells in 4 open-source projects over 2
months. Through this experiment, we analyzed: (i) the impact that
test smells refactoring has on internal quality attributes; (ii) developers’ 
perception of test smells, as real problems within a system;
and, (iii) main difficulties encountered by developers during test
smells refactoring. Our findings indicate that: (i) the Eager Test and
Duplicate Assert test smells are the most harmful to the internal
quality of the system; (ii) the refactoring test smells the source
code easier to understand; (iii) some developers do not consider
test smells as real problems within a software project; (iv) the developers
did not consider the Assertion Roulette and Magic Number
Test smells to be real problems; and, (v) understanding the source
code is one of the main difficulties encountered by developers. Our
findings can help developers design a prioritization scheme for test
smells refactoring and make them aware of the real benefits of
refactoring test smells.
